1. Overview
GMU Connect is a matchmaking and networking platform intended to help George Mason University students find study partners, form project groups, and build academic or social connections. By inputting your courses, skills, and areas of need, you are matched with others who either have taken similar courses or possess complementary skills.

Example Use Cases:

Two students who both need to study for the same course (e.g., CS211) get matched.
A student needing help in CS211 and offering help in MATH114 finds a student offering help in CS211 but needing assistance in MATH114.
Students looking for hackathon teammates or forming study groups for final exams.


2. Key Features
Smart Matching: Find peers based on shared interests, classes, or complementary needs.
Collaboration Made Easy: Form study groups, manage availability schedules, and work on projects together.
Career & Networking: Expand your professional circle with like-minded students while also building friendships.
Privacy & Security: Only verified GMU students have access, ensuring a safe environment free from spam and scams.
Personalized Experience: Customize your profile with courses, majors, and interests so the recommendation engine can show you the most relevant posts and people.

3. Why GMU Connect?
Problem
GMUâ€™s commuter culture can make it challenging for students to form meaningful connections. Many are not sure who shares their interests or who is willing to collaborate/study together. Approaching classmates can be intimidating, and there is no easy, centralized way to find study partners, particularly outside major-specific tutoring (e.g., math tutoring centers).

Solution
GMU Connect provides a trusted environment focused on smaller groups or one-on-one connections, powered by a need-based and interest-based matching system. It solves the shortcomings of broader platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, and Reddit (where there is a high volume of irrelevant posts, spam, and scam risk) and goes beyond Mason360 (which mainly emphasizes large events and clubs but not individual-level connections).****
